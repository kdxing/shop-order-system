This is a simple, efficient and minimalistic order system that can be used by small shops to manage their orders. Small shops usually don't have an order system on a computer, but simply use a paper-and-pen system. This usually works, but during holidays (Christmas, Easter) this method of working is impractical. This order system can help small shops to store, catalogue, manage and analyse their orders during these hectic periods as to save them precious time and money.

The project is a Visual Studio 2010 project built in C# .NET 4.0.
The GUI is created with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
It uses a local MySQL database to store data.
